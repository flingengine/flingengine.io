I have officially made Ergo Witness open source! It is capable of building to Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is under the MIT License, so please feel free to fork it and use to to visualize whatever data you want!! The wiki is there with information about all methods that I have written, and which classes do what.

This visualization was used in the national CCDC competition, NCIS, and IRSeC successfully. Keep in mind that I built this for a target audience of people who do not fully understand networking, and I wanted to give them a general idea of what was going on.

This is also released on the Google Play store! <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benhoffman.ergowitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check it out!</a>

Windows, Mac, and Linux builds are available here.

If you do need help setting this visualization for your own competition, please let me know! I would be happy to help out! The same goes for if you have questions about why I made one class the way that I did, etc.
