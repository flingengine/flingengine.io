<p>This visualization was used in the national CCDC competition, NCIS, and IRSeC successfully. Keep in mind that I built this for a target audience of people who do not fully understand networking, and I wanted to give them a general idea of what was going on.</p>

<p>This is also released on the Google Play store! <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benhoffman.ergowitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check it out!</a></p>

<p>Windows, Mac, and Linux builds are available here.</p>

<p>If you do need help setting this visualization for your own competition, please let me know! I would be happy to help out! The same goes for if you have questions about why I made one class the way that I did, etc.</p>
