For a recent class project, I had to make an audio visualizer using JavaScript with a canvas. I think that it looks pretty cool, and I am proud of how it turned out.

You can check out the audio visualizer [here!](https://people.rit.edu/~bah8892/330/projects/audioviz/final/AudioViz/web-audio-visualizer-start.html)Â There are a couple of settings to mess around with, and I especially like the inverted color scheme as well. This was a really interesting project, and it was a ton of fun to make! I would really recommend doing this if you are into JavaScript and wanna make something cool.
