I know that Extra Life doesn&#8217;t happen until November, but it&#8217;s best to get an early start on this stuff! This will mark my third year participating in this event, and I have a lot of plans going forward about this.

For now, I made a new team for the RIT Game Development Club. We plan on doing a charity game jam around this event, where the general idea is that we stream people&#8217;s progress on their jam games, and collect donations throughout the jam.
